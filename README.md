📊 SkillCraft Internship | Task 03: Decision Tree Classifier on Bank Marketing Data
As part of my internship at @SkillCraft Technology, I completed Task 03, which focused on building a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer would subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and behavioral attributes.
📂 Dataset Used:
 The Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
🛠️ Key Steps:
Performed data preprocessing and handled categorical variables with one-hot encoding
Trained a decision tree classifier on customer data
Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
Visualized the decision-making process using plot_tree from Scikit-learn
✅ Tools & Skills Used:
 Python | Pandas | Scikit-learn | Seaborn | Matplotlib | Decision Tree | Classification | Data Science
This task strengthened my machine learning skills and gave me hands-on experience in customer behavior prediction using classification models.
